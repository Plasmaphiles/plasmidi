    <p>
      Plasma is an engineering sandbox game where you can create your own
      devices and worlds. Recently, they added the ability for you to create a
      variety of sounds large enough to be able to play real music in Plasma.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plasma, being an open sandbox, is not geared directly towards music
      creation, and even with this great new functionality, it would still be
      difficult to hand-transcribe music into a form workable in Plasma.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's where we come in. We made this tool to allow you to upload any MIDI
      file and get back text that's actually able to be directly handled in
      Plasma.
