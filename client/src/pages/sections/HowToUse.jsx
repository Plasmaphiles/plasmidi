      Upload a MIDI file and click the "Process file" button. After that, some
      text will appear in the output section. It will likely be shortened, as
      there tends to be a lot of text in the output, so click on the Copy to
      Clipboard button and then you can return to Plasma to paste that text into
      our music-playing device.
